## Heavily inspired by [OSBMX](hhttps://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/tree/main/OSBMX) and [Circle Keycaps](https://github.com/rana-sylvatica/circle-keycaps).

3 piece assembly to make arcade-like buttons with Kailh Choc v1 switches. This is an initial repo to share what I've done so far before commiting to using them on a build. They work pretty well. Most of the dimensions are based from sanwa's 24 mm buttons, which is the only available size for now.
